# About

The Factory is a boutique venture capital fund and studio focused on early stage investing. We believe that great
companies can be built in a systematic, repeatable hands-on way. The Factory is research led and has a clear thesis
on the fundamental technology shift that is enabled by Data-Centric AI, and the opportunities that shift is creating.
We serve as a catalyst and platform, enabling the founders to build what they know needs to be built, and removing
the burden and distraction of company building.

The Factory’s founders include Chris Ré, an Associate Professor at Stanford University and the recipient of the 2015
MacArthur Foundation “Genius Award”, and Lip-Bu Tan, Chairman of Cadence and Chairman of Walden International.
The founders have an extensive track record as co-founders and backers of such companies as Lattice Data,
SambaNova, Snorkel, PA Semi and others, and are complemented by a team of experienced operators with decades of
industry experience.

The combined network of the founders, operators, researchers and partners allows the Factory to back innovative
companies built on cutting edge research and critical projects in the AI/ML space coupled with a deep understanding
of the needs and opportunities created at the intersection of business and AI/ML.
Access to the Factory and its portfolio companies provides a steady stream of leading edge companies, access to
ground-breaking thought leadership from widely recognized experts in the field and an opportunity to take early
advantage of industry-leading innovations with the potential to accelerate and transform business with Foundation
Models and Generative AI.
